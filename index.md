I am a computer science student at CSUF and I expect to graduate in 2026. 

## Favorite CPSC 120 Labs

* Lab 1

  This was one of my favorites because it taught me how to use github, the terminal, and VS code. It was a great introduction to coding. I had fun trying to figure out how to use the terminal and run commands for the first time. 

* Lab 3

  This is one of my favorite labs because this lab introduced me to how to use doubles, cin, and cout. I also think it was a good lab to show me how to use coding to calculate equations. It was also cool at the end when I ran the program and I was able to plug in numbers into the program. 

* Lab 6

  I enjoyed this lab because it introduced a new way of using cin and cout commands. I think it was cool when I ran the program and I was able to plug in values and my program worked. It also showed me how to use true and false statements.
